						Richard Melville Hall was born in the Manhattan, New York City neighborhood of Harlem to Elizabeth McBride (née Warner), a medical secretary, and James Frederick Hall, a chemistry professor who died when Richard was two years old.[10][11][12] He was raised by his mother in Darien, Connecticut.[13][14] <br>
						According to Hall, his middle name and the nickname "Moby" were given to him by his parents because of an ancestral relationship to Moby Dick author Herman Melville: "The basis for Richard Melville Hall—and for Moby—is that supposedly Herman Melville was my great-great-great-grand uncle."[15]<br>
						He has also released music under the names "Voodoo Child"[16] and "Schaumgummi."[17]<br>
						During the 1980s, Hall played guitar for the hardcore punk band Vatican Commandos.[18] Later in the decade, he was a guitarist for the alternative rock group Ultra Vivid Scene and appeared in the video for their 1989 single "Mercy Seat."

						Starting in around 2001, Moby launched a series of co-owned business ventures, with the two most prominent being the "Little Idiot Collective"—a New York City, U.S. bricks-and-mortar clothing store, comics store, and animation studio[92] that sold the work of an "illustrators collective"—and a small restaurant and tea shop called Teany. Teany was cofounded in 2002 with his ex-girlfriend Kelly Tisdale.[93] In a November 2006 interview, he said he had removed himself from any previous business projects.[94]<br>
						In November 2015 Moby opened the Vegan bistro Little Pine in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles, California.[95] The restaurant serves organic, vegan, Mediterranean-inspired dishes and has a retail section with art and books, curated by Moby himself.[96] Moby's vision was to create a space that includes various aspects of society that he cares about. All of the restaurant's profits are donated to animal welfare organizations.<br>
						On August 23, 2016 Moby announced the inaugural Circle V Festival along with the official video for 'Don't Leave Me' by Moby & The Void Pacific Choir.[97] The event took place at LA's Fonda Theatre and featured Blaqk Audio & Cold Cave on the bill amongst others in the evening and talks and vegan food stalls in the afternoon. Moby described Circle V as "the coming together of my life’s work, animal rights and music. I couldn’t be more excited about this event and am so proud to be head-lining." [98]<br>
						The second Circle V event took place on November 18 this time at The Regent Theatre in Los Angeles. Moby headlined the event for the second year with artists Waka Flocka Flame, Dreamcar and Raury featuring on the bill.[99]
